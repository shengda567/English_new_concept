so for the past 20 years, I have been helping Malaysians and other Southeast Asians to speak better
English. through training thousands of(数以千计) Southeast Asians, I've discovered a very surprising truth.
I've discovered that how well somebody communicates in English, actually has very little to do with their
English level. It has a lot to do with their attitude towards English. there are people out there who have
a very very level of English and they can communicate very very well. one of them I remember was a student, 
the participant of mine, named zhang, he was a factory supervisor. english level very very low, but this guy 
could just sit and listen to anybody calmly, clearly, and he could respond. absolutely express his thoughts
beautifully at a very low level of English. today I want to share with you what is so different about people
like faisal, how do they do it? and second of all, why is this so important not only to you, but also to your children, to your 
community, to the future of Malaysia. the third of all, what's one thing you can do starting today if you want to speak English
with that calm and clear confidence that people like faisal has. what is so different, how do people like
faisal do it. to answer that question I'm going to take you back about 10 years, I was training staff at that time, 
and my daughter, at that time, was taking piano lessons. And I start to notice two really strong similarities
between my daughter's attitude or thinking towards playing the piano and a lot of Malaysians' thinking or attitude 
towards English. first of all, I should tell you, my daughter absolutely hated the piano, hated the lessons, hated 
practicing, this is my daughter playing piano, this is as good as it got. this is the real thing.
and she dreaded going to piano lessons, because to my daughter, going to piano lessons, she was filled with this sort of 
dread. because it was all about not screwing up, right? because like for a lot of piano students, to both my daughter and her teacher,
the success in piano was measured by how few mistakes she made. at the same time, I noticed that a lot of Malaysians went into Englishi 
conversations now with the same sort of feeling of dread. this sort of feeling that they were going to be judged by how many mistakes
they were going to make and whether or not they were gonna screw up. the second similarity that I noticed was to do with self-image.
she knew what good piano sounded like, because we've all heard good piano. she knew what her level was. and she knew how long she'd have to 
play for to play like that. and a lot of Malaysians I noticed had this idea of what good proper English is supposed to sound like, I see a lot
of you nodding. and what their English sounded like. and how far they'd have to go to get there. they felt like they were like my daughter just bad,
 bad piano player, bad english speaker, right. what is it about people like faizal that are so different that can just do it smoothly, calmly,
 with confidence? One day, I discovered that answer and I discovered it quite by chance. It was a day when my computer broke down and I had to  go 
 to cybercafe. it was my first time, and I discovered cycbercafe are disgusting places, okay, they are really gross. they are smelly, and they are
 filled with boys. they are playing noisy, violent games, they are just disgusting games. but I had to go there so I sat down.  I start noticing this guy
 beside me and I'd become very very interested in this guy next to me. this guy is playing this game that basically, it's like 
 shooting people until they die. that's it, I'm noticing that this guy is not very good, he's like in fact terrible right, I'm looking I'm seeing like 
 a lot of shooting, but not much dying, what really interested me was that behind this lousy player were three of his friends sorts of standing there watching him play.
 what I really noticed was even though this guy was terrible, even though his friends were watching him, there was no embarrassment, there was no feeling of being judged,
 there was no shyness, in fact, quite the opposite, this guy's totally focused on the bad guys, smile on his face. all he can think about is killing these guys. I'm watching him
 and I suddenly realized, this is it. this is the same attitude that poople like faizal have when they speak english, just like this guy.
