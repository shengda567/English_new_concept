I'm the center of attention I can bolster my own identity, but there is another reason we get distracted,
the average person talks at about 225 words per minute, we can listen at up to 500 words per minute, so our mind 
are filling in those other 275 words, i know it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but
if you can't do that you're not in the conversation, you are just two people shouting out barely related sentences 
in the same place, you have to listen to one another sc said very beautifully, most of us don't listen with the intent to
understand we listen with the intent to reply, one more rule and Norton and it's this one, be brief, all of this boils down
to the same basic concept, and it's this one, be interested in other people, you know I grew up with a very famous grandfather
and there is a ritual in my home, people would come over to talk to my grandparents, after they would leave my mother would come 
home to us and she'd say do you know who that was? she was the runner-up to Miss Amereica, he was the mayor of sacramento,  she 
won the pulitzer prize he is russian ballet dancer, I started I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden amazing thing about 
them, honestly,I think it's what makes me a better host, I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open and 
I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I never disappointed, you do the same thing, go out talk to people listen to people and most 
importantly be prepared to be amazed.
