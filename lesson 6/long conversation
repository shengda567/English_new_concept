Iâ€™m vanessa from speakingEnglishwithvanessa.com, my husband, who is also going to be giving another perspective in today's conversation. today, we're bringing you an amazing, long, english conversation, so prepare your ears, prepare your mind, we're going to talk about 12 different topics, and hopefully providing some new expressions, new ways to think about life, I don't know about that, but at least some english help for you. it's going to get personal today, so get ready, yeah, are you ready to get started? I'm ready, let's get started, the first topic is family, who do you think you are the most like? who am i the most like, in appearance? both appearance and character? so appearance I look mostly like my mom, I think, I have more of her skin tone, I have her eyes. on her side of the family, most of people are pretty skinny, and I'm a rather skinny guy, my dad's side is German, and they tend to be a little bit bigger, I definitely got my mom's side, character-wise, I think I am a little more like my dad, would you agree, I'd say that you have shades of your dad, you know me so well, so you can answer this too, I think you have shades of your dad, I think I'm more silly than my dad, that's not very hard because my dad is pretty serious.
he's got a silly side though. he does ,yeah, but for the most part, I think, I'm more like my dad because he has a very calm demeanor, he's very patient, and he doesn't get stressed about anything. actually, my dad gets so unstressed about everything, I even can't understand it, I'm like how are you so calm right now, and everybody I know thinks that I'm the most stress-free person they know. but your dad is even more stress free. we are similar, like growing up when parents would be going somewhere. and needing to get out of the house, me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time. we would be like what, we'll make it, we'll be okay, no problme. and your brother and your sister were saying come on hurry,  my mom is like, let's go, my mom is much more high stress, anxious kind of personality. that's kind of a typical family situation.I think I have both parents in me as well, I think I look a lot like my mom, she looks exactly like her mom, like to a T, sometimes when I see pictures of myself, and then I look at a picture of her at the same age, we look really similar, she looks a lot like her mom, so I can kind of imagine what I'll look like when I'm getting older. you have a darker hair, the darker feature, you got that from your father, yeah somewhat, but I think a lot of my features are similar to my mom, but I think I also got my facial expressions from  my mom, a lot of comment that, wow, vanessa, you have a lot of expressions. your mom is very expressive, jus like you, I think it's true that I use a lot of expressions but it's just natural for me, I do this in daily life as I'm talking about things,
and I think that I got that from my mom, sometimes I see some of her experssions and I realize that I do that too. I remmember that when we lived in south korea, every single korean person was commenting on vanessa's expressions, they are like, your face, it's so exciting, how are you making so many faces, everybody was surprised, I guess in korea they don't make as many faces, I don't know maybe it's just not. maybe it's just an unusual trait. I'm grateful for that, especially as a teacher, I can hopefully help to explain some different concepts with my faces as well, I feel like I also have parts of my dad, my dad is pretty a rational guy, you are rational like your dad, but I think I also have his sense of humor, sometimes a little strange sense of humor, but we laugh at the same things, we enjoy playing games, and being competitive, so I thinke that that side of me, maybe some of the character of me. It's similar to him.
